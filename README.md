# BlackMagic Design DaVinci Speed Editor - C# USB Wrapper

The **BlackMagic Design DaVinci Speed Editor** shows up as a USB HID (Human Interface Device), but it requires some authentication before you can read from it or control the LED status.

## Remarks

The following GitHub repositories laid the foundation for this project. I only took what they released and translated it into C#. A huge thanks to the original contributors: `@smunaut`, `@davidgiven`, and `@haavard15`, who did all the hard work. To them, we should all give our gratitude.
